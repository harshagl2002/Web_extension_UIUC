# Web_extension_UIUC
allows UIUC students to search for courses in a filtered manner through course explorer 


The goal of this workshop is to improve the courses.illinois.edu course explorer website by adding on functionality. It allows students to 

directly search a course in the top bar (currently we can type major but not number)

automatically creates a google maps link for class locations
